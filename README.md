Fake News Detector

This is a web-based Fake News Detection application built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning. The app is designed to help users quickly determine whether a news article is real or fake.

It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning models. Two different models are implemented:

Random Forest Classifier – A robust ensemble model that aggregates multiple decision trees for accurate predictions.

Logistic Regression – A lightweight model that predicts the probability of a news article being real or fake.

Features:

Users can enter any news text to check its authenticity.

Choose between Random Forest and Logistic Regression for predictions.

Color-coded results: True News in green, Fake News in red.

Shows which model made the prediction for transparency.

Lightweight and easy-to-deploy Flask web app.
